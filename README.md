# Game rules:
•	Before any of the players starts playing, the order of playing turns must be determined. For that, each player must throw the dice to obtain the largest possible number. In case of a tie between any of the players, the process is repeated only between those players. This process is concluded once the order of playing is determined. 

•	At this point, the players start playing the game by alternating dice flipping. 

•	Each dice flip will move a player form square 0 (which you can think about it as outside the board) with the value of the dice. For example, if a player is at square 0 and the dice value was 5, then the player moves to square 5. 

•	If the reached square has a bottom of a ladder, then the player moves up to the square that has the top of the ladder. For instance, if a player is at square 33, and the flipped dice value was 3, then the player moves to square 36, which in turn will end moving the player up to square 44. 

•	If the reached square has a head of a snake, then the player moves down the square that has the tail of the snake. For instance, if a player is at square 77, and the flipped dice value 2, then the player moves to square 79 (which has the tip of the snake’s head), which in turn end moving the player down to square 19.
